# tc-automanualbackup
Automatically performs the tasks of a manual data backup with minimal user input.

## Todo:
- For any folder copies requiring user input (non-standard folders), prompt for these immediately at the start of the program, THEN start the backup
- Move unnecessary verbosity to the log file

- Better naming scheme for log files
- Verification that files successfully transfered
- Threading to do simultaneous file transfers
- Better formatting for log files (use custom logging format)
