# tc-automanualbackup
Automatically performs the tasks of a manual data backup with minimal user input.

## Todo:
- Log output
- Prompt for non-standard folder backups
- Go file-by-file through work folders since they cause issues

- Build to an .exe for easy deploy
- Verification that files successfully transfered
- Threading to do simultaneous file transfers
