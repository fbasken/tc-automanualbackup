# tc-automanualbackup
Automatically performs the tasks of a manual data backup with minimal user input.

## Todo:
- Prompt on a case-by-case-basis for non-standard folder backups

- Build to an .exe for easy deploy
- Verification that files successfully transfered
- Threading to do simultaneous file transfers
